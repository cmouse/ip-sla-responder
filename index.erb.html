            <p>
              This software is intended as drop-in replacement for Cisco or Juniper device for IP SLA measurement counterpart. It acts as responder for measurement messages sent by network devices. It lets you configure one IP address that will be responded to on up to 4096 different VLANs without configuring these or the IP address on the server.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
             This project started out as need to get single point of response for cisco and juniper devices. Another requirement for the software was to be able to respond with same IP address to multiple VRFs with as little configuration as possible. This, in the end, ment that the software had to handle the ethenernet frames itself. Unexpectedly, this turned out to be faster than what cisco or juniper devices can handle the responses.
